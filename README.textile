branch: k2

Exploratory branch:

* easy configuration with sensible defaults
* defense against large inputs: use commons-io BoundedInputStream
* move from Jetty to http-kit, or create helper libs/plugins for each server type
* response encoding based on requested content-type: json, xml, edn
* Multiple Apps mounted in 1 server
* kinematic.mq: bake CQRS concepts into kinematic; async and rpc via queues, simpler callbacks for async rpc
* kinematic.rpc.sync: json/edn over HTTP (http-kit/client) or raw sockets (zeromq)
* kinematic.rpc.async: rpc with a 'callback' either over a socket or an mq with delivery back


h1. Overview

Kinematic provides a simple library for doing dynamic web development with clojure. Although currently, it is mainly geared towards creating a JSON pump to your frontend API, it can be expanded in the future to be a more full-featured web development framework.
