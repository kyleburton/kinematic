PUT and POST

Defense against bad requests.

* Instead of slurp, support a max request body size and only read up to that many bytes.

* Be Opinionated: if the body is empty, or doesn't look like it's JSON
  formatted i.e. doesn't start with '{', then return BadRequest and a
  message indicating that it't not valid JSON for the framework.

* If json/read-str throws an exception
  return BadRequest with a message explaining that it's invalid JSON.
