;; TODO: kinematic was created for 'api first' web apps, to support
;; (for the most part) single page apps.  The example should
;; demonstrate that paradigm.

;; TODO: stop assuming Jetty
;; TODO: Pattern matchers should collapse adjacent slashes
;; TODO: Mount multiple apps at distinct mount points.
;; TODO: Output Serializers:
;;   Dispatch Table based on the requested ContentType, there are several default behaviors:
;;      application/json:  takes whatever data strucutre the handler returns and runs it through clojure.data.json/json-str
;;      application/xml:   takes whatever data strucutre the handler returns and does what?
;;      text/html:         takes whatever data strucutre the handler returns and does what?
;;      tex/plain:         takes whatever data strucutre the handler returns and calls str on it.
;; What's the minimum we can say to get an app up and running?

;; TODO: how to bake in testing for kinematic?
